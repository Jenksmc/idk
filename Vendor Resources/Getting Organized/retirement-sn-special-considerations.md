# Retirement SN Special Considerations

## Things to Keep in Mind

When a retirement is planned for an AGC Service, customers need to be notified multiple times, starting at a maximum of three (3) years in advance (for a “full retirement”). The AzComms team is responsible for sending out those communications based on the following schedule:

- 3 years from retirement
- 2 years from retirement
- 1 year from retirement
- 6 months from retirement
- 3 months from retirement
- 1 month from retirement
- 2 weeks from retirement

>[!NOTE]
>If a retirement is planned in six (6) months, or less, it is considered an “emergency retirement” and requires additional layers of approval. 

For retirement SNs, the requestor will only submit one (1) LS IcM ticket in advance of the actual retirement date. System automation will create new ADO cards seven (7) days in advance for each of the iterations as described above. This means that a new ADO card will be created a week prior to the 2-year SN deadline, and again before the 1-year deadline, etc. Those additional ADO cards will link back to the original LS IcM ticket. 

In addition, the requestor will need to submit HS IcM tickets – with updated targeted communication lists – for each iteration of the communication. The subsequent comms created in ACM will use the updated targets from the most recent HS IcM ticket. 

>[!NOTE]
>Since the original retirement IcM ticket will already have been acknowledged, the operator cannot acknowledge it again. 

### Retirement SN Cancellations 

With retirements, there is automation that will create all subsequent iterations of the retirement communications. However, sometimes the customer usage of the Service being retired drops to zero (0), or we find out that the retirement does not actually impact the AGC. 

In these instances the AGC AzComms team should note this in the ADO Discussion and properly fill out the rest of the ADO card accordingly.

### Retirement Communications Process

The SN process for all the iterations of the retirement communications is the same as any other SN. Follow the steps described within the pages on this site to send out the retirement comms.
