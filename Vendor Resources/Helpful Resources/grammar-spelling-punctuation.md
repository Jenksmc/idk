## Details Matter

The AGC AzComms team is responsible for drafting and sending out critical information to Microsoft’s government customers. That, in effect, makes the AGC AzComms team members the spokespeople on behalf of Microsoft SNs are sent out. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the messages sent out by the AGC AzComms team be polished and – at a minimum – do not include errors in: 

- Grammar
- Spelling
- Punctuation

The team has several tools at their disposal to mitigate these kinds of mistakes, including: 

- Spelling check inside the fields in ADO
- MS Word grammar and spelling tools
- Copilot integrated in MS Word, or accessed through a browser, to assist with language, tone, grammar, and spelling

The AzComms operators should always use these tools to check the communications before sending them to the EIM for review, as well as before sending them to the HS to be published.  

## Microsoft Writing Style

Most of the communications our operators send are based on templates with standardized text. However, several of the communication types require the operator to describe events and actions taken. For that text, operators are required to use Microsoft’s approved writing style. Examples: 

- To confirm the ways certain words should be written – like "backend" vs “back-end."
- To double-check if the words "hang" or “DDOS” are permitted in communications.
- To align the customer comms with Microsoft's “voice.”
