## Quality Assurance Reviews 

The quality of every message sent by the AzComms team is reviewed within several days of a Service Notification ADO card being marked as resolved. As part of that QA review, all the messages sent for every SN are checked by AFS leadership specifically for: 

- Spelling and grammar mistakes 
- Selection of ACM attributes with each communication (Region, Service, Event Type, Comm Stage) 
- Correct use of message templates 
- Approved LS messages match the messages sent on the HS 
- Removal of any internal (not customer-facing) information 
- Working HS hyperlinks (or commercial cloud hyperlink annotation)

Operators should always keep these specific areas of concern in mind. 

To meet the program’s stated QA benchmarks, the AzComms team operators need to ensure there are very few of these kinds of mistakes made in every SN communication.
