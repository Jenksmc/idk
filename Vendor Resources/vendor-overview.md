# Managing Service Notifications

`@@LastModified`

---

This section of the Service Notification (SN) EngHub site is intended to document the process and detailed steps for the Azure CXP AirGapped Clouds (AGC AzComms) __vendor__ team to communicate with customers regarding impactful and non-impactful upcoming scheduled platform and Service changes.

>[!NOTE]
>This TSG does _not_ cover the process for managing communications related to Outages or Live Site Incidents. For Outage communications, see the [Azure Outage Communications site on the EngHub](https://eng.ms/docs/cloud-ai-platform/azure-edge-platform-aep/cai-silver/experience-silver-/silver-problem-management/azure-outage-communications). 

## Vendor Overview

The Azure CXP AirGapped Clouds (AGC AzComms) team is one of two (2) teams responsible for the creation and dissemination of customer communications for Microsoft Azure. The AGC AzComms team is engaged when a planned change will occur within the classified US government Clouds (USNat and USSec). The AGC AzComms team manages the communications related to these events – called “Service Notifications” (SNs) – that keep government customers informed about the details of the upcoming change, and if any actions are needed on their part.  

An SN is a **proactive**, **timely**, and **targeted** message about planned changes to an AGC Service. The Service changes can be customer impacting (data or control plane), or not customer impacting (billing). In addition, some planned maintenance requires customers to take action on their side to accommodate the changes.

>[!NOTE]
>The Azure CXP LSI Communications team handles communications related to the Public Cloud and the non-classified US government Cloud (Fairfax).  

Targeted communications are published to the Azure Subscriptions identified during the communication authoring process. There are several different types of SNs which are published in the Azure AGC Portal through the Service Health notification blade. SNs are grouped into the following categories, with different processes and timelines: 

- Planned Maintenance / Migrations 
    - DCOps 
- Retirement of Service(s) / Features 
- Customer Take Action / Action Required / Breaking Changes 
- Information 
- Billing 
- Emergency Maintenance

The SN process helps manage customer expectations, reduce frustration and confusion, maintain transparency and trust, deflect unnecessary support demand for members of the field, and empower customers to better make informed decisions for their business and Azure solutions.

Once the team has received a request for an SN, the operator that picks up the assignment should follow the directions below to publish the SN communications.

### Our Team's Scope
